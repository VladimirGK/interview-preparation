# Clean code 

## Meaningful Names

We name and name and name. Because we do so much of it, we’d better do it well.

### Use Intention-Revealing names

The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. 
It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name 
requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent. 

### Avoid Disinformation

Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. 
We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning. 

### Use Pronouceable Names

If you can’t pronounce it, you can’t discuss it without sounding like an idiot.

### User Searchable Names

The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope.
